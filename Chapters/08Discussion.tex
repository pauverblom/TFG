\chapter{Discussion}

In this chapter, you should expand on your results and address your main research questions (the research
questions were stated in Chapter \ref{chap:Introduction}). You should post-process and discuss the results already presented in Chapter \ref{chap:Results}.

What kind of information can you deduce based on the results you have compiled and presented in the Result section? How do the different results you have obtained compare to what you expected or to results reported by others? Cross-plot your results to extract information. Discuss variation between re-runs.

What do the results tell us? Try to answer your research questions. Provide the information you said you wanted to provide by conducting this study. Can you draw conclusions, and in particular, can you answer your research question? Can you give a negative answer? If not, is then a positive answer probable?
