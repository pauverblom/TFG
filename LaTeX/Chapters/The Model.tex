\section{Theory}

We are interested in connecting the interaction rate of photons with energy $E$ to the pair-production cross section $\sigma_{\text{pair}}(s)$ and the spectral density of background photons $n_{\gamma}(\varepsilon)$. We can do so in the following manner\begin{equation}
    R_{\gamma}(E) = \frac{1}{2}\int_{0}^{\infty}d\varepsilon \,n_{\gamma}(\varepsilon)\int_{-1}^{1}d\mu\,(1-\mu)\,\sigma_{\text{pair}}(s)\,\Theta(s-s_{\min}),
    \label{eq:interaction_rate_first_one}
\end{equation} where $s_{\min}$ is the threshold energy for pair production ($s_{\min} = 4m_e^2$ in this case, $m_e$ being the mass of an electron), and $\Theta(s-s_{\min})$ is the Heaviside step function. It is there to ensure we only integrate over energies above the threshold. The pair-production cross-section $\sigma_{pair}(s)$ is well-known, and is given by the equation

\begin{equation}
    \sigma_{\rm pair}(s)=\frac{3}{4}\,\sigma_{{\rm Th}}\, \frac{m_e^2}{s}
     \left[(3-\beta^{4})\ln\frac{1+\beta}{1-\beta}-2\beta(2-\beta^{2})\right]\!,
    \label{eq:sigma-pair}
\end{equation} where $\sigma_{\rm Th}$ is the Thomson cross-section, $\beta \equiv \sqrt{1-4\,m_e^2/s}$, $s = 2E\varepsilon\,(1-\mu)$ and $\mu \equiv \cos(\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle between the incoming photon and the produced electron.

From equation \eqref{eq:interaction_rate_first_one}, it is convenient to rewrite the integrals in terms of the mandelstam variable $s$, and swap the order of integration. Doing so, we get the following:


\newpage

\begin{equation*}
    R_{\gamma}(E) = \frac{1}{8E^2}\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{d\varepsilon}{\varepsilon^2}\,n_{\gamma}(\varepsilon)\int_{s_{min}}^{4E\varepsilon}ds\,s\,\sigma_{pair}(s) =
    \label{eq:interaction_rate_second_one}
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation}
    =  \frac{1}{8E^2}\int_{4m_ec^2}^{4E\varepsilon_{max}}ds\,s\,\sigma_{pair}(s)\int_{\frac{s}{4E}}^{\varepsilon_{max}}\frac{d\varepsilon}{\varepsilon^2}\,n_{\gamma}(\varepsilon)'
    \label{eq:interaction_rate_third_one}
\end{equation}
Notice that for a given s, we have $s \leq 4E\varepsilon$, which implies that $\varepsilon \geq \frac{s}{4E}$. This is the reason for the lower limit of the $\varepsilon$-integral. The upper limit of the $\varepsilon$-integral is $\varepsilon_{max}$, which is the maximum energy of our background photons.

In order to find this interaction rate of photons with energy E, we need to know the spectral density of background photons $n_{\gamma}(\varepsilon)$. In order to derive this quantity, we first neede to know what the spectral energy distribution of background photons looks like. \citet{Eichmann_2022} used in their work a spectrum of background photons for the starburst and X-ray corona region, which can be seen in Fig. 5 of their paper.

I will use this background spectrum to model the density of background photons $n_{\gamma}(\varepsilon)$. In figure \ref{fig:background_spectral_density}, I have represented the data from \citet{Eichmann_2022} as black dots and triangles, to get an idea of the rough shape of the SED. The two main components of the SED can be seen, one for the starburst region, which is modeled by Planck's Law (which I have fitted onto the data), and one for the X-ray corona region.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/Background_SED_AGN.pdf}
    \caption{Spectral Energy Distribution of the background photons inside the AGN of NGC 1068, with the fitted Planck's Law for the starburst region and the piecewise function for the flux of background photons.} 
    \label{fig:background_spectral_density}
\end{figure}

Using these two regions, I have constructed a rough piecewise function for the differential flux of background photons $\Phi(\varepsilon)$ (the red line in figure \ref{fig:background_spectral_density}), which is given by the following equation

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:piecewise_phi}
    \Phi(\varepsilon) = \left\{
    \begin{array}{ll}
        10^{9.7}\,\varepsilon^2 & \text{, } 10^{-6} \leq \varepsilon \leq 4.3 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{eV}\\
        10^{3.9}\,\varepsilon^{-2.25} & \text{, } 4.3 \times 10^{-2} \leq \varepsilon \leq 2.6 \times 10^{5} \, \text{eV}\\
        10^{35}\,\varepsilon^{-8} & \text{, } 2.6 \times 10^{5} \leq \varepsilon \leq 10^{8} \, \text{eV}\\
        
    \end{array}
    \right.
\end{equation}

$n_{\gamma}(\varepsilon)$ can be connected to $\Phi(\varepsilon)$ in the following manner: we know that the differential flux of background photons relates to the specific intensity $I(\varepsilon)$ by

\begin{equation}
    \Phi = \int d\Omega I \cos \vartheta
    \label{eq:flux_specific_intensity}
\end{equation}

For a spherical source of radius $R$ at a distance $d$, $\Omega = \pi \left(\frac{R}{d}\right)^2$

We can also connect $I(\varepsilon)$ to the spectral density of background photons $n_{\gamma}(\varepsilon)$ using

\begin{equation}
    n_{\gamma}(\varepsilon) = \frac{4\pi}{c}I(\varepsilon)
    \label{eq:n_phi}
\end{equation} where $c$ is the speed of light. By combining equations \eqref{eq:flux_specific_intensity} and \eqref{eq:n_phi}, we can find the spectral density of background photons $n_{\gamma}(\varepsilon)$ in terms of $\Phi(\varepsilon)$
\begin{equation}
    n_{\gamma}(\varepsilon) = \frac{4}{c}\left(\frac{d}{R}\right)^2\Phi(\varepsilon),
    \label{eq:n_gamma}
\end{equation}
where $d$ is the distance to the AGN, and $R$ is the radius of the corona.

For this work, I will assume that the distance to NGC1068 is $d = 10.1$ Mpc, and the radius of the corona is $R = 7 \times 10^{-5}$ pc. These values come both from \citet{padovani2024highenergyneutrinosvicinitysupermassive}. The coronal radius can be parametrized as $R = \eta R_s$, with $\eta \sim 10 - 100$ (I shall assume $\eta = 50$), and $R_s$ being the Schwartzschild radius of the black hole, calculated to be around $1.4 \times 10^{-6}$ pc.



% \chapter{Theory}
% \label{chap:Theory}

% The theory section is not as common to include as the other sections included in this document. Some work is theory-heavy, and it can be beneficial to split the theory part from the background and methodology parts of the document. In this document, we will rather use this section to show some important \LaTeX commands that you are likely to use.

% When you write in \LaTeX, try to just follow the given style. You might not like the exact way of the given style in your document, but if you try to change it with small commands everywhere, you will probably end up with a document that looks worse, and you will spend a lot of time writing \LaTeX code in your document.

% \section{Equations}

% A simple equation or variable can be written within sentences using the dollar sign on each side, for example, writing \verb=$a$= will show up as $a$. The usual way of including an equation on a separate line is either by using double dollar signs, such as this:
% $$E = mc^2$$
% or using the \texttt{equation} environment:
% \begin{equation}
%     E=mc^2
%     \label{eq:Einstein}
% \end{equation}
% \sloppy Note that the \texttt{equation} environment will enumerate the equation, and allow you to add a label that you can refer to later. When labeling the equations, you can refer to them using \verb=\eqref{<label>}=, which will give you an equation reference like Eq.~\eqref{eq:Einstein}.

% The text below shows an example of how to align equations on the equal sign, with only one reference for both. This may be useful for when they are linked and are actually only one equation but splitting them up makes it more readable.
% \begin{equation}
% \begin{aligned}
%         a &= \sin^{2}(\Delta\phi/2) + a \sin^{2}(\Delta\phi/2) \\
%          &= (1+a) \sin^{2}(\Delta\phi/2)
% \end{aligned}
% \label{eq:splitTwoLines}
% \end{equation}
% The whole equation can be referenced as a single equation, Eq.~\eqref{eq:splitTwoLines}. One may also align sub-equations such that they are numbered the same but have a letter differentiating them as shown below\footnote{A footnote explaining something.}. This can be used when they are linked, but you will need to reference both individual parts.

% \begin{subequations}
% \begin{align}
%     \sigma &= \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \mu)^2}
%     \label{eq:sd}\\ 
%     \mu &= \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N x_i \label{eq:mean}
% \end{align}
% \label{eqn:subeqn}
% \end{subequations}\\
% These equations can be referenced by their specific sub-equation as Eq.~\eqref{eq:sd}, or by the whole group as Eqs.~\eqref{eqn:subeqn}.


% \section{Including figures}

% Figure \ref{fig:qualityDiff} is an example of how to include figures in your \LaTeX document. This is also an example of the difference between a vector-based image format (pdf) and a voxel-based format (png). When possible, always try to use a vector-based image format, as that gives infinite resolution.

% These two figures were created using this simple Python code:

% \lstinputlisting[firstline=1, lastline=17,language=Python]{Figures/createPlot.py}

% So when you create figures using Python, try to save them as pdf, as use the tight boundaries to save some space around the figures.

% \begin{figure}[H]
%   \centering
%   \subfloat[Sinus figure using pdf.]{\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{Figures/sin.pdf}\label{fig:sinpdf}}
%   \quad
%   \subfloat[Sinus figures using png.]{\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{Figures/sin.png}\label{fig:sinpng}}
%   \caption{Figure (a) shows a pdf figure, while figure (b) shows a png figure. If you zoom in, you will start noticing the difference in quality.}
% \label{fig:qualityDiff}
% \end{figure}

% With Python you could change the size of your figures. This is helpful for getting the right size of text within figures. In Figure \ref{fig:SizeDiff} we compare two different sizes.

% \begin{figure}[H]
%   \centering
%   \subfloat[Sinus figure using size (8,8).]{\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{Figures/sinBig.pdf}\label{fig:sinBig}}
%   \quad
%   \subfloat[Sinus figures using size (4,4).]{\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{Figures/sinSmall.pdf}\label{fig:sinSmall}}
%   \caption{This is a comparison between two different figure sizes.}
% \label{fig:SizeDiff}
% \end{figure}


% \section{Chemical notations and units}

% This document has included a package for chemical symbols, \texttt{mchem}. When you write \verb=\ce{CO2}= you will get the chemical notation as \ce{CO2}.

% For units we use the \texttt{siunitx} package. If you write \verb=\SI{10}{\meter\per\second\squared}= you get \SI{10}{\meter\per\second\squared}. The package can be used within math mode (inside the dollar signs). It automatically changes to a fixed notation for numbers, such as \verb=\SI{1E5}{\meter}= gives \SI{1E5}{\meter}.
